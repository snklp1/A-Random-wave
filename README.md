# A-Random-wave
just a simple C++ program which generates waves of height of different proportions with each run. The height of each wave is changed with each unit and each run too. But the individual strands take the same time to generate. The user also has the option to choose between different speeds of generation and can also input their own unitary symbol which shall be the main wave unit.
